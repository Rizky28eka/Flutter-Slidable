## Flutter Slidable

### Description

Flutter Slidable is a Flutter sample application that showcases the usage of the flutter_slidable package to create swipeable item views with various actions. In this example, we display a list of swipeable items within a ListView.separated, and each item has different action options when swiped to the left or right.

### Features

- Swipeable item views with different actions on each side
- Utilizes flutter_slidable for easy and efficient implementation
- Uses faker to generate fake data (name and address)
- Implements sizer for responsive design based on device size
